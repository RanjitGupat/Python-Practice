# 2. Write a program to find out whether a student has passed or failed if it requires a
# total of 40% and at least 33% in each subject to pass. Assume 3 subjects and
# take marks as an input from the user.

# Taking marks as input

total_marks = sub1 + sub2 + sub3
percentage = (total_marks / 300) * 100  # 3 subjects Ã— 100 marks each

# Checking conditions
