# 6. Write a program to calculate the grade of a student from his marks from the
# following scheme:
# 90 – 100 => Ex
# 80 – 90 => A
# 70 – 80 => B
# 60 – 70 =>C
# 50 – 60 => D
# <50 => F

# Taking marks as input
marks = float(input("Enter your marks (0-100): "))

# Determine grade
if 90 <= marks <= 100:
    grade = "Ex"
elif 80 <= marks < 90:
    grade = "A"
elif 70 <= marks < 80:
    grade = "B"
elif 60 <= marks < 70:
    grade = "C"
elif 50 <= marks < 60:
    grade = "D"
else:
    grade = "F"

# Output grade
print("Your grade is:", grade)
